# Classwork
Classwork is not hosted publicly to avoid showing up when students Google.

Please raise an issue if you would like access to any of the source code or further details.

  - Primarily C++ and MATLAB, with some projects in Java and Perl
  - Foundational work such as implementing linked lists, sorting and searching, classes, etc.
  - An astrodynamics toolbox developed during independent research using OOP in MATLAB. It worked, but I strongly do not recommend doing OOP in MATLAB.
  - AI and ML work, as well as Game AI development
  - Senior capstone project which involved developing a tactile sketchpad for the visually impaired, using an arduino and stepper motors
