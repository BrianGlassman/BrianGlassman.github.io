# Classwork
Classwork is not hosted publicly to avoid showing up when students Google.

Please raise an issue if you would like access to any of the source code or further details.

- Astrodynamics Toolbox:
  - ASEN 6008 Interplanetary Mission Design - CU Boulder, Spring 2022
  - ASEN 5052 Analytical Astrodynamics - CU Boulder, Fall 2021
  - https://github.com/BrianGlassman/astro_toolbox
  - A toolbox for creating, manipulating, and plotting orbits in an idealized 2-Body Problem [implemented in Python]
- CSCI 5525 Compiler Construction - CU Boulder, Spring 2022 [implemented in Python]
  - A lexer/parser and compiler for generating x86 assembly instructions from arbitrary input in a subset of Python
- CSCI 5828 Foundations of Software Engineering - CU Boulder, Spring 2022
  - (Class in progress, check back later)
- CSCI 5302 Advanced Robotics - CU Boulder, Fall 2021 [implemented in Python]
  - Value and Policy Iteration algorithms
  - Motion planning with RRT and RRT*
  - Final project using ROS to control a simulated Mars rover
- CSCI 5448 Object Oriented Analysis and Design - CU Boulder, Fall 2021
  - Implementing a store simulation including UML diagrams, various forms of inheritance and pattern usage, and JUnit tests [implemented in Java]
  - Recreating a Pokemon battle game using Python, including a TKinter GUI and various forms of inheritance and patterns
- Undergraduate work - Drexel University, Fall 2012 - Spring 2017
  - Primarily C++ and MATLAB, with some projects in Java and Perl
  - Foundational work such as implementing linked lists, sorting and searching, classes, etc.
  - An astrodynamics toolbox developed during independent research using OOP in MATLAB. It worked, but I strongly do not recommend doing OOP in MATLAB.
  - AI and ML work, as well as Game AI development
  - Senior capstone project which involved developing a tactile sketchpad for the visually impaired, using an arduino and stepper motors
